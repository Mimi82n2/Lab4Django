Question 1: What is the link to your github repository for this lab?
A. https://github.com/Mimi82n2/Lab4Django

Question 2: After starting a brand new Django application and running the runserver command, what does the browser show you?
A. It shows a rocket and says "The install worked successfully! Congratulations!"

Question 3: After creating the first view within polls, what does the browser show you when navigating to / and to /polls respectively?
A. Navigating to / shows Page not found (404)
   Navigating to /polls shows the message "Hello, world. You're at the polls index."

Question 4: What is a Django migration and why do we need them?
A. According to the Django documentation, migrate checks the INSTALLED_APPS setting in settings.py and creates any necessary database tables according to the our database settings. With makemigrations, we're letting Django know that we've changed our models and that we'd want the changes to be stored as a migration, we can then use migrate to apply these changes to the database.

Question 5: What do you see after you log into the Django adminstration site? From a high levle, how do you get custom models to appear in the Django admin page?
A. When I log into the admin site I can see the Django adminstration page. From there, under "Authentication and Authorization administration," I can add and change Groups and Users. Under "Polls," I can add and change Choices and Questions.
   To get a custom model to appear in the admin page we can add the model to our admin.py file and use "admin.site.register(model_name)".

Question 6: What do you see when you go to /polls/38/ in your browser? What about /polls/38/results and /polls/38/vote? What happens when you donâ€™t put a number, and instead use a string? How would you modify the urls.py file to allow arbitrary alphabetic characters?
A. At /polls/38/ I see the message "You're looking at question 38."
   At /polls/38/results I see the message "You're looking at the results of question 38."
   At /polls/38/vote I see the message "You're voting on question 38."
   If I use a string instead of a number, I get Page not found (404).
   To allow alphabetic characters, we can go to polls/urls.py and change <int:question_id> to <str:question_id>

Question 7: Why is it a bad idea to hardcode urls into the templates?
A. It is a bad idea to hardcode the urls into templates because that would increase coupling.
   It would be more difficult to change your URLs when you have several templates with hardcoded URLs.

Question 8: What are the benefits of using Django's generic views over writing views 'the hard way'? When should you use a generic view and when shouldn't you use a generic view?
A. Generic views uses abstraction and allows us to write less code without having to worry about very common functions in web applications.
   You should use generic views when the features it provides are sufficient and you don't want to implement them yourself.
   You should not use generic views if you have a very specific use case where the built in features are not sufficient.
